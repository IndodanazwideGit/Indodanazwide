# Hello, I'm Bukeka Nxumalo ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a second-year Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology student at Durban University of Technology in South Africa. My journey into the world of technology began in 2022, fueled by a deep passion for both Software Development and Data Analysis & Management.

## Passion for Software Development ðŸš€
My fascination with technology started early and rapidly evolved into a dedicated pursuit of backend development. During my first year of studies, I was introduced to C#, which ignited my enthusiasm for the .NET Platform. This powerful framework has become a focal point of my academic and personal projects, offering a dynamic environment for developing robust applications.

## Exploring Data Analysis ðŸ“Š
In parallel to my development journey, Iâ€™ve delved into Data Analysis. My interest in this field began with learning SQL Databases, where I discovered the importance of data in driving decision-making and optimizing processes. SQL has provided me with a strong foundation in managing and analyzing data, and Iâ€™m keen to expand my skills further.

### Future Goals ðŸŒŸ
As I progress through my degree, my goal is to become a proficient software developer or data analyst. Iâ€™m committed to leveraging my technical skills to contribute to innovative projects and tackle real-world challenges. Beyond coding and data analysis, Iâ€™m dedicated to exploring emerging technologies and staying abreast of industry trends to continuously enhance my expertise.
